            Hello! Congratulations! After working hard for four years, it has finally paid off. 
            It feels awkward to say I‚Äôm proud of you because I wasn‚Äôt there on your journey, but 
            I really am proud of you because I know that in those four years‚Äîbeing a student must not have been easy. 
            It was a long, long, long ride, but look at you now‚Äîsino ang ggraduate? Ikaw.
           <br />

           <br />
            I hope this gesture of mine won‚Äôt affect you or put pressure on you in any way. 
            I like you not because of the attention you‚Äôre giving, but because of who you are. 
            A person who is untouchable, driven, and knows what she wants in life. This hooman will just be right here kaya go do your thing.
            Let‚Äôs hope for the best and trust in Him for what‚Äôs to come.
            <br />

            <br />
            Will you allow me to be part of your success? How about setting aside some time at the end of the month for a date?
